# In_out

- The input folder (<code>input_files</code>) contains all model parameters, data, the structure of one socio-demographic IBM, along with vaccination scenarios (<code>scenarios_txt/scenarios_N.txt</code>, which is identical to <code>scenarios_csv/scenarios_N.csv</code>). The vaccination data (<code>input_files/VaksinertPerKommune.txt</code>) is a demo with added noise on the original data for privacy reasons. 
- For running one tranmission simulation locally, <code>names_scenario.txt</code> contains information specific to the scenario taken from one row of the scenario file (<code>scenarios_N.txt</code>). The default scenario is taken from the 3rd row of the scenario file. 
- The output folder (<code>output_files</code>) contains six files from one simulation of the IBM.
